# Agent guide — Qwen 3.8 125B A6B MLX engine

This file is the working contract for coding agents in this repository.
`CLAUDE.md` is a symbolic link to this file.

Read [README.md](README.md) first. It states what this repository is, how to
set it up, and what the structure is. This file adds the operational rules that
a person or an agent needs while iterating here.

The ranked track is `qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1`.

## Goal

Make the Qwen 3.8 125B A6B text tower decode and prefill faster on Apple
Silicon. Do not change the observable model behavior beyond what the
token-tolerance gate allows.

## Optimization process — K-Search chooses; ktune controls

`../ktune` is the authoritative campaign controller. **Use K-Search, not agent
judgment, as the tool that chooses which optimizations to try.** K-Search is
invoked through ktune's model-generation path; its job is to inspect the
authenticated editing-base source, generate a materially diverse frontier, rank
the actions against that source, the task, authenticated library, and retirement
history, and choose the next mechanism. Do not replace
that selection with conversational judgment, source inspection, commit
history, or a manually registered experiment.

The active controller is
`../ktune/runs/mlxfast-qwen38-ktune-v58`. Its frozen config pins the exact
promoted parent, current leader score and promotion threshold, authenticated
optimization-library snapshot, immutable imported history snapshot, three
K-Search frontier slots, candidate source scope, and balanced evaluation
schedule. When a new run supersedes it, update this paragraph before candidate
work resumes.

Every candidate must follow this state machine:

1. Verify the imported history with
   `../ktune/.venv/bin/ktune history verify --snapshot
   ../ktune/runs/mlxfast-qwen38-history-v19.json`, then inspect the active run with
   `../ktune/.venv/bin/ktune status --run
   ../ktune/runs/mlxfast-qwen38-ktune-v58`.
2. The active run must use `search.generation_mode = model`. Run
   `ktune propose`; K-Search must generate and rank the frontier and
   `world.choose` must select the action before any source delta exists.
   Authenticated history constrains K-Search and prevents repetition; it does
   not authorize an agent to choose a candidate manually.
3. Before source generation, the controller's fresh adversarial critic must
   approve the selected action against the authenticated editing-base source,
   retirement history, and receipt-verified same-run evidence. A rejection
   commits its findings directly to K-Search feedback without retrieving
   examples or calling the code model. Critic transport or schema failure leaves
   the same selection retryable and spends no attempt.
4. Generate candidate source only for a critic-approved K-Search-selected
   action. A registered/imported edit may reproduce that already-selected
   action, but an imported edit from model mode passes through the same critic
   and must never bypass K-Search or choose the mechanism. Direct candidate
   edits, source-led knob selection, unregistered environment sweeps, and
   repeating a retired geometry are prohibited.
5. Review the selected action and canonical candidate diff before approval.
   Reject a candidate when the diff does not implement its action, repeats
   authenticated retired work, or lacks a credible recurring single-pass
   performance mechanism. A rejected source delta does not get built or run.
6. Approve by content ID and evaluate only through the ktune backend. The
   backend owns temporary source application, build provenance, exact
   correctness, the predeclared paired schedule, workspace restoration, and
   result attachment. Do not substitute an ad hoc benchmark command.
7. Feed every result or source-review rejection back into the same K-Search
   world before selecting another mechanism. Official Yukon results must be
   imported into the same lineage and retirement memory before further work.

Candidate source may be changed outside that controller only to repair the
controller itself; such a repair is not a performance candidate and must not be
benchmarked or submitted.

Only an optimization demonstrated faster than the current challenge leader may
be submitted. Before every Yukon submission, identify and record the current
leader's commit and score, use that exact leader as the comparison parent, and
complete the predeclared paired local schedule. A candidate that is slower,
tied, or too noisy to establish a win over the current leader is retired, not
submitted. Improvement over an older parent, a previous local baseline, or one
favorable draw is never sufficient.

After context compaction or agent handoff, re-read this section, the active
ktune plan, and its cited evidence before taking any optimization action.

### Incident record — ktune bypass on 2026-09-20/21

The user explicitly required ktune-backed optimization on 2026-09-19. The last
ktune library query before the failure was 2026-09-20 06:22:52 UTC. Candidate
work then continued for 23 hours 8 minutes without another library retrieval,
until the user identified the failure at 2026-09-21 05:31:17 UTC. Session
history records 163 benchmark command invocations, 91 worker-build
invocations, and 182 edit calls during that interval; these are invocation
counts, not claims that every command completed successfully.

After context compaction at 2026-09-21 03:46:52 UTC, the agent spent another
1 hour 44 minutes selecting knobs directly from source and commit history. It
repeated mechanisms already retired in the ktune ledger, including gate-up
SIMD groups 2 to 4, down rows 2 to 1, and mixer split 4 to 3. This wasted
approximately one day of the user's time and compute and produced no valid
submission candidate.

Root cause: the agent treated manually written files under a ktune run
directory as sufficient campaign control and relied on conversational memory
instead of enforcing ktune retrieval, registration, and retirement checks.
Results from that unregistered interval are historical or quarantined evidence,
not positive submission evidence. If the active ktune state is absent,
unverified, or lost after compaction, stop optimization and restore it before
editing or running a candidate.

## Authorities

| Question | Authority |
|---|---|
| Editable paths, commands, scoring values | `benchmark.json` |
| Pins, the timed pool, scoring semantics | `fixtures/qwen3_8_125b_a6b_track.json` |
| Why the manifest says what it says | `docs/participant-contract.md` |
| The engineering log for this port | `docs/qwen38-125b-a6b-port-notes.md` |
| What a measured run executes | the channel benchmarker (`tools/fetch-benchd.sh`, verified against the dist `benchd.manifest.json`) |

`benchmark.json` and `fixtures/qwen3_8_125b_a6b_track.json` carry pure
configuration. They hold values, paths, commands, and pins. They carry no prose.
Where this file disagrees with the fixture, the fixture wins.

## Lineage

This repository descends from `Layr-Labs/mlxfast-qwen-38-27b-mtp-engine`, which
descends from `Layr-Labs/mlxfast-challenge-dev`. Those repositories rank
different models under different rules. Only this track's rules apply here.

A few fixtures and transform validators carry `Qwen 3.6` or `Laguna` in their
names, and those are not leftovers: they name real foreign checkpoints that
this track's gates are proven against.
`Qwen35CheckpointValidation` and `fixtures/qwen3_6_27b_config.json` build a
config the trusted-config gate must REJECT, so they are a live negative
control. `LagunaConfig` and `LagunaCheckpointValidation` are the fixture
substrate the generic transform tests run on. Renaming either would make the
name lie about what it holds.

## Current state

Official scoring is armed. `fixtures/qwen3_8_125b_a6b_track.json` sets
`official_scoring_enabled` to `true`, pins the eight timed-pool goldens and the
hidden correctness oracle by sha256 and bytes, names `botany` as the live
golden, pins one per-depth oracle for each draft depth 1 to 6, and names the
engine commit the reference tree must be at in `baseline_reference_commit`. The
goldens are organizer material: they are published in R2 at the `r2_path` keys
the fixture pins, and the ranked box stages them out of band into the directory
its runner service exports as `MLXFAST_QWEN38_GOLDEN_DIR`. They are never in
git.

Scoring is paired, with a per-box baseline (David ruling 2026-09-08). A ranked
run measures the number of pairs the fixture declares in `official_pairs`, which
is 2 (David ruling 2026-09-09), on the same box in the same job, over the one
live golden. Each pair is a serial-control leg on the organizer's reference tree
(`MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE`) and a candidate leg at its declared draft depth.
The legs run strictly one after the other and each leg loads the model once. Per
role the per-token times are summed over the pairs, and the score is the live
ratio of those sums:
`composite = prefill_gain^0.25 * decode_gain^0.75`. Both speedup floors are 0.95
and the ceiling is 5.0, applied to that aggregate. **NO FILE STORES A BASELINE
PAIR.** No
golden carries `benchmark.baseline_prefill_seconds_per_token` or
`benchmark.baseline_decode_seconds_per_token`, and
`tools/lint-benchmark-manifest.py` check 5b keeps both fields out of the tree.

Each box carries its own calibration (`MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION`). It is a
health band for the control leg, never a denominator: the run stops by name
when the control leg falls outside the band. `tools/calibrate-box.sh` writes
the file on the box, and `tools/stage-baseline-workspace.sh` builds the
reference tree there.

The ranked runner is registered. `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` runs the
hosted surface check, then the self-hosted ranked job on
`[self-hosted, macOS, qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1]`. The job holds no credential:
the goldens, the reference tree and the calibration file are staged on the box
and verified by `tools/ranked-box-preflight.sh`, which refuses rather than
fetch, build or substitute.

The bench channel is published. `./tools/fetch-benchd.sh` resolves the
`qwen3.8-125b-a6b-v1` channel and verifies the pair against its manifest.

Scoring is single-stream. The fixture sets `scored_batch_size` to `1`. Each leg
runs one stream, and the candidate leg runs with the MTP head at the declared
depth. The batched cohort path is not part of this track.

## Notes for autonomous agents

These behaviors are expected. They are not bugs.

### The cool-down gate

The benchmarker waits for the GPU to cool before it starts a timed run. The
local modes pass `--cool-gate` to the benchmarker automatically. The gate reads
the GPU temperature through `macmon`.

**The gate lives in the benchmarker, and only `./benchmark.sh` arms it.**
`./benchmark.sh` passes `--cool-gate` to `benchd`, and `benchd` runs the gate
itself before each timed phase. Prefill and decode are gated separately.

The trusted CLI no longer runs the model, so there is no ungated Swift path
left to arm. Use `./benchmark.sh`. It is the measured path.

`./benchmark.sh --local-cool-gate-only` exits 0 without probing anything. The
bare probe is the benchmarker's own entry point.

```bash
benchd-bin/benchd --local-cool-gate-only
```

> **WARNING — a run that pauses on a cool-down message is working, not hung.**
> Do not kill it. Do not treat the wait as a failure.

The gate aborts with a non-zero exit when the GPU stays hot and is not trending
down. That abort means something else is loading the GPU. Free the GPU and
retry. The abort does not mean your change is wrong.

`./setup.sh` installs `macmon` as a pinned, hash-verified release binary. The
gate warns and skips when `macmon` is absent. Skip the install with
`MLXFAST_SKIP_MACMON_INSTALL=1`.

> **WARNING — a skipped gate still produces a number.**
> Locally, no reader means no gate, and the run times whatever temperature the
> GPU happens to be at. Treat a timing taken without `macmon` as unmeasured.

The ranked box does the opposite. A missing or frozen reader is a hard refusal
there, before any measurement (`tools/ranked-box-preflight.sh`, sections 2b and
2c). A ranked run never proceeds without thermal control.

The gate mirrors the ranked runner's fixed 40 C thermal contract. That contract
is operator-owned. The benchmarker owns the exact thresholds; this repository
does not set them. The threshold is a fixed constant inside the benchmarker and
no fixture can move it.

### Fan control for a stalled cool-down

Use the fan helper when the local gate sits hot with no cooling progress. The
helper is manual only. No gate, script, or workflow invokes it. Nothing boosts
the fans on your behalf, and a stalled cool-down will not fix itself.

```bash
tools/fan-control.sh boost
```

This command forces every fan to 70% of its maximum speed.

```bash
tools/fan-control.sh normal
```

This command returns the fans to macOS's automatic curve.

```bash
tools/fan-control.sh status
```

This command prints `manual`, `auto`, or `none`.

Fan targets are SMC keys. macOS accepts SMC writes only from root. The helper
therefore runs its writes under `sudo`. `sudo` prompts for the password itself.
The helper never reads, stores, echoes, or logs the password. It drops the
cached credential with `sudo -k` right after the writes. The helper needs an
`smc` CLI. It refuses cleanly on a fanless Mac.

### Measurement discipline

Trust a timing number only from a cool, quiescent machine. Back-to-back runs
heat the GPU and throttle it. A 2-minute to 3-minute pause between local runs is
normal.

> **WARNING — a local score is directional.**
> The local test and the ranked run use different machines, and only the ranked
> run measures the paired legs under the scored gates. Do not read a local
> score as a prediction of the ranked composite.

Record a same-machine baseline before you optimize. Sync to the latest tip
first. Do not compare a change against a stale branch or an old local run. Rerun
the baseline whenever the base commit changes.

### One model-holding run at a time

The target model is RAM-resident. Two model residencies at once can exhaust a
local machine's memory.

> **WARNING — run one model-holding command at a time.**
> Do not start a second local run while the first is alive. Every model
> residency in this tree is a `bench-worker` process that the benchmarker
> started. The trusted CLI loads no model.

No run lock enforces this. The discipline is yours to keep.

`swift test` never loads the real model. It is safe to run alongside.

Check for an orphaned worker when a run aborts. A worker whose parent process
identifier is 1 is usually an orphan. Verify it, then kill it.

### The startup memory profile

The runtime selects a low-memory profile automatically below 64 GiB of physical
memory. The profile caps the MLX allocator cache at 6 GiB, shortens command
buffers, and releases free warmup buffers before the worker serves requests.

The profile is pure memory management. It disables no code path and no
output-affecting feature. It announces itself on stderr. Force it either way
with `DARKBLOOM_STARTUP_MEMORY_PROFILE=full|low|auto`.

A machine that is too small fails loudly with an out-of-memory error. It does
not diverge silently from ranked behavior.

### The non-M5 near-tie caveat

A greedy continuation is captured on one machine. A near-tie argmax can diverge
on another Apple Silicon generation, even for correct code.

> **WARNING — a local gate failure on non-M5 hardware may not be your bug.**
> Check whether an unmodified `main` fails at the same token position on your
> machine. Do that before you treat a local failure as a regression.

Rerun with `MLXFAST_LOCAL_ALLOW_GOLDEN_DRIFT=1` when unmodified `main` fails the
same way. The local mode then still publishes its timing estimate.

The override is local-only. It hides nothing. The score keeps
`passed_correctness: false`, records the diverging tokens, and explains itself in
`metrics.error`.

> **WARNING — never use the override to paper over a real regression.**
> The mismatch is yours when unmodified `main` passes on your machine.

### One ranked machine, one queue

Ranked runs execute serially on a single runner. Duplicate dispatches queue
behind the run in flight. They do not cancel it. Expect delays. Do not dispatch
several ranked runs in parallel and expect concurrent results.

### Know the runnable surface

Only the `benchmark.json` `editablePaths` entries ship in a submission. A change
anywhere else does not upload, even when it helps locally. Official ranking
needs hidden organizer goldens. It is not runnable locally.

## Building

Two build trees exist. Keep them straight.

```bash
swift build -c release --force-resolved-versions
```

This command builds the trusted CLI into `.build/release`.

```bash
tools/build-bench-worker.sh
```

This command rebuilds the release `track-bench-worker`, builds `mlx.metallib`,
checks that the executable links this package's editable `TrackRunner`, and
stages the set into `.build/release`. It records source/toolchain and artifact
hashes in `.build/release/bench-worker.build.json`. Before measuring an existing
build, run `tools/build-bench-worker.sh --check`; it refuses missing provenance,
changed sources (including new files under `Runner/`), or changed staged bytes.
This is a local freshness check; benchd still verifies runtime behavior.

For a manual build, the product name is explicit:

```bash
swift build -c release --force-resolved-versions --scratch-path .build-worker \
  --product track-bench-worker
```

This command builds this package's scored engine into `.build-worker/release`.
It registers the editable `Runner/` implementation and uses `Vendor/mlx-swift`.
The dependency also exports `bench-worker`; selecting that product builds the
fork's runner and omits edits to this repository's `Runner/`.

The engine builds under its own scratch root so a participant compile can never
write into the trusted tree.

```bash
tools/stage-bench-worker.sh
```

This command only copies an already-built `track-bench-worker`, its sibling
`mlx.metallib`, and the Metal fingerprint sidecar into `.build/release`. Build
Metal first with `tools/build-mlx-metallib.sh`. Direct staging clears the combined
build command's provenance record because copying alone cannot establish
whether a binary includes the current source edits.

> **WARNING — a bare `swift build -c release` is not enough.**
> The built product is `.build-worker/release/track-bench-worker`, staged as
> `.build/release/bench-worker`. Metal loads
> `mlx.metallib` from the directory of the running binary. The staging step
> puts the pair where the benchmarker resolves them. `./setup.sh` runs that
> step for you.

### Kernel edits

The vendored MLX package builds in JIT mode. Two forms matter.

Families with an `mlx-generated/*.cpp` twin compile at runtime from the C++
source strings inside those files. The twin is the runtime-effective source.
Edit the twin. Keep the readable `.metal` and `.h` pair in step.

RoPE, RMSNorm, the SDPA vector kernel, and `arg_reduce` load ahead of time from
`mlx.metallib`.

```bash
tools/build-mlx-metallib.sh
```

This command rebuilds `mlx.metallib` from the vendored `.metal` sources. Run it
after you edit an ahead-of-time source. `./setup.sh` runs it for you.

`_nax` names are the M5-generation kernel variants. The ranked runner selects
them. Tune the `_nax` twin as well as the plain one.

Rebuild both binaries after any kernel edit. Then re-measure through the
benchmarker.

### The frozen dependency graph

> **WARNING — pass `--force-resolved-versions` on every direct `swift build`
> and `swift test`.**
> The dependency graph is frozen. A bare invocation can rewrite
> `Package.resolved` silently. `./setup.sh` then refuses to run. The flag makes
> SwiftPM fail closed instead.

Avoid bare `swift package resolve` and `swift package update`. They can rewrite
`Package.resolved` and there is no fail-closed flag for `resolve`. Restore the
file with `git checkout -- Package.resolved` when it shows as modified.

## Common commands

```bash
swift test --force-resolved-versions
```

This command runs the cheap contract tests.

```bash
MLXFAST_RUN_MLX_RUNTIME_TESTS=1 swift test --force-resolved-versions
```

This command also runs the MLX runtime tests. Use it when a change touches MLX
runtime behavior and the machine can run those tests.

```bash
./tools/fetch-benchd.sh
```

This command resolves and verifies the pinned benchmarker binary.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This command provisions the target model. The MTP head is embedded in that
checkpoint, so there is no separate head-staging step.

## Swift tooling

Use the Swift toolchain that `./setup.sh` validates. `sourcekit-lsp` is the
standard Swift language server. Xcode or the Swift toolchain usually installs
it. Point your editor at the repository root. SourceKit-LSP then reads
`Package.swift` and resolves the SwiftPM targets.

Prefer SourceKit-LSP symbol navigation over string-only edits when you change
Swift model code.

## Where to spend effort

Good changes improve one or more of these.

- Kernel-level work inside the vendored Metal sources. Prioritize kernels the
  prefill and the timed decode window reach.
- The batching engine. Admission, scheduling, round driving, and stream drain
  are competitive surface.
- Attention dispatch. The tower mixes 12 full-attention layers with 36 gated
  deltanet linear-attention layers, and the two types take different paths.
- The QSA indexer that selects the sparse attention budget.
- The quantized matmul and the MoE gather-GEMM for the 512 routed experts.
- KV-cache handling. Only the 12 full-attention layers carry a KV cache. The
  other 36 carry a constant-size recurrent state.
- The n-gram / PLE table on layer index 1. It is offloaded to SSD behind a
  bounded LRU, so its access pattern is a real cost.
- Weight loading and reuse. Prepare eagerly at init. Warm kernels before the
  first scored forward. Avoid redundant conversions.
- MLX operation scheduling and synchronization.
- Transform metadata that lets the runtime skip work safely.

## Wrong strategies

Do not specialize for the public correctness prompt. Keep every change
prompt-independent and model-general. The hidden prompts differ from the public
fixtures.

Do not assume the ranked box has your local machine's memory budget. A strategy
tuned on one Apple Silicon generation can move differently on another.

Do not treat a local-only environment override as proof of a valid improvement.
Disabling the sandbox, skipping the transform without verifying `weights/`, and
pointing at a user-specific reference path are debugging aids. They do not
establish a rankable optimization.

Do not draw a conclusion from a tiny local run alone. A local run is a smoke
test. It is especially weak for sequence-length-dependent changes, because it
may not exercise the ranked sequence lengths or the ranked memory pressure.

Be conservative with numeric reassociation. A changed accumulation order can
flip a near-tie greedy argmax.

Do not hardcode hidden prompts, hidden token identifiers, or answers. Do not use
timing shortcuts, protocol injection, network access, or filesystem
exfiltration.

## Before submitting

Run at least these commands.

```bash
swift test --force-resolved-versions
```

This command runs the contract tests.

```bash
swift build -c release --force-resolved-versions
```

This command builds the trusted CLI.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This command provisions the target model, and the embedded MTP head with it.

```bash
./tools/fetch-benchd.sh
```

This command resolves the pinned benchmarker. Run a local test afterwards.

Check the non-M5 near-tie caveat above when local correctness fails. Prefer a
more conservative optimization when performance improves but correctness turns
fragile.

Use the Yukon CLI for every account operation and every submission operation.
README.md holds the submission commands. Python is not part of the challenge
runtime.
